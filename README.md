## Introduction

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ As an MSc student enrolled in the Exploratory Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) course, I've taken on an exciting project called "Lithology Prediction for Ocean Drilling Program." This project is my chance to dive into the world of data science and machine learning, aiming to assist the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) in predicting lithologies from downhole log data.

Our goal here is to help IODP understand the types of rocks found in the seafloor by analyzing drilling and logging data. By leveraging data science techniques, I'm working on building a model that can accurately classify these lithologies based on various features obtained during drilling operations.

This project involves several key tasks, starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I'm delving deep into the provided data, exploring its characteristics, relationships, and patterns to gain a solid understanding before diving into model development.

Next up is the model building phase. I'll be using machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model capable of classifying lithologies. The challenge lies not only in achieving high accuracy but also in meeting specific criteria set by IODP, such as model simplicity and performance.

In addition to creating the predictive model, I'll be crafting a specialized LithoEstimator class. This class aims to streamline the lithology prediction process, making it easier to deploy and use the model effectively.

This project is a fantastic opportunity for me to apply what I've learned in class to a real-world problem in Earth sciences and marine geology. I'm excited to explore data, train models, and ultimately contribute to IODP's mission of understanding the Earth's dynamics and past climates.
